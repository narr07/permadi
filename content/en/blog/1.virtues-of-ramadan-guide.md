The holy month eagerly awaited by Muslims worldwide has finally arrived. The **virtues of the month of Ramadan** lie not only in the obligation of fasting but also in the abundance of rewards and forgiveness offered by Allah SWT. For every Muslim, understanding the essence of this month is the first step toward maximizing their worship.

Ramadan is more than just refraining from hunger and thirst from dawn until sunset. Beyond that, it is a spiritual moment to cleanse the heart, practice patience, and increase piety (*taqwa*).

In this comprehensive guide, we will thoroughly explore the various excellences of this holy month, correct worship procedures, and health tips to keep you fit while fasting.


## Why is the Month of Ramadan So Special?

Allah SWT has made Ramadan the most noble month among all others. There are many reasons why this month is so special, but here are the primary points:

### 1. The Month the Qur'an Was Revealed (Syahrul Qur'an)

The monumental event of the revelation of the Qur'an took place in this month. As Allah says in Surah Al-Baqarah verse 185, Ramadan is the time when guidance for mankind was first sent down. Reading and contemplating the Qur'an in this month carries multiplied rewards.

### 2. The Gates of Heaven are Opened, the Gates of Hell are Closed

One of the most heart-soothing **virtues of the month of Ramadan** for believers is the Hadith of the Prophet SAW, which mentions that the gates of heaven are opened wide, the gates of hell are tightly shut, and the devils are chained. This is a golden opportunity to focus on worship without heavy distractions from worldly desires.

### 3. A Month Full of Forgiveness (Maghfirah)

Who wouldn't want their sins forgiven? Fasting performed with faith and *ihtisab* (hoping for reward) will expiate past sins. This is the best time to repent and improve oneself.

### 4. The Presence of Lailatul Qadr

Within this month lies a night that is better than a thousand months. Worshipping on the night of Lailatul Qadr is equivalent to worshipping for more than 83 years.

## Guide to Primary Worship in Ramadan

To ensure your fasting is not in vain, it is important to know the various highly recommended acts of worship. In addition to the obligatory fast, here are the sunnah deeds you should not miss.


### Tarawih and Witir Prayers

Tarawih prayer is a specific *qiyamul lail* (night prayer) that only exists during the month of Ramadan. You can perform it in congregation at the mosque or individually at home. While the number of rak'ahs varies (some do 8 or 20), what matters most is devotion and consistency.

### Increasing Almsgiving (Sadaqah)

The Messenger of Allah SAW was the most generous of people, and he became even more generous during the month of Ramadan. **Sadaqah** in this month can take the form of:

- Providing food for breaking the fast (*iftar*) to those who are fasting.
- Paying zakat mal (if it has met the *haul* and *nisab*).
- Assisting orphans and the needy.

### I'tikaf in the Last Ten Days

Toward the end of Ramadan, it is recommended to perform I'tikaf, which is staying in the mosque with the intention of worship. The goal is to draw closer to Allah and seek the night of Lailatul Qadr.

## Health Tips to Stay Strong While Fasting All Day

Performing the act of fasting certainly requires prime physical condition. Often, poor eating habits actually make the body weak and prone to illness.

Here are strategies to maintain health during the fasting month:

### 1. Do Not Skip Suhoor

Suhoor is your primary energy source. Choose foods containing complex carbohydrates such as brown rice, oats, or whole-wheat bread to stay full longer. Don't forget to consume protein and fiber.

### 2. Meet Your Fluid Needs

Dehydration is the main enemy during fasting. Apply the **2-4-2** drinking pattern:

- 2 glasses during *iftar* (breaking the fast).
- 4 glasses at night (between Tarawih and before bed).
- 2 glasses during Suhoor.


### 3. Break Your Fast Promptly with Natural Sweets

When the Maghrib Adhan sounds, break your fast immediately. It is recommended to consume dates or plain water first. Avoid immediately eating a large meal or drinking excessively cold ice water, as it can shock the stomach.

### 4. Get Enough Sleep

Despite many nightly acts of worship, do not drastically reduce your sleep time. Manage your sleep pattern—for example, by sleeping earlier after Tarawih or taking a short nap (*qailulah*) during the day if possible.

## Common Mistakes Often Made During Ramadan

To maximize the **virtues of the month of Ramadan**, avoid these frequently unnoticed mistakes:

- **"Revenge" Eating During Iftar:** Overeating to the point of being too full, which leads to laziness in performing Tarawih.
- **Sleeping All Day:** Although the sleep of a fasting person is considered worship, spending the entire day sleeping causes you to miss opportunities for good deeds.
- **Gossip and Emotions:** Fasting is not just about refraining from hunger, but also refraining from speech and negative emotions. The reward for fasting can be nullified if you continue to gossip or lose your temper.

## Conclusion

The month of Ramadan is a noble guest that brings a multitude of blessings. By understanding the **virtues of the month of Ramadan** and applying the correct worship guide, we hope to emerge from this month as more pious individuals.

Do not let Ramadan pass by as just another annual routine. Prepare your physical health, knowledge, and heart starting now. Happy fasting!
