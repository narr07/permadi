## Why Accelerated Learning and the Merdeka Curriculum Are a Perfect Match?

Have you ever imagined a classroom where students learn with enthusiasm, responsiveness, and without pressure? Implementing **accelerated learning in the Merdeka Curriculum** is the key to making this a reality. The Merdeka Curriculum gives teachers the freedom to innovate, and *accelerated learning* provides science-based methods to maximize that innovation.

The Merdeka Curriculum focuses on essential material and the character development of the Pancasila Student Profile (*Profil Pelajar Pancasila*). This system no longer chases the completion of dense material but rather deep understanding. This is where *accelerated learning* fits in naturally.

This fast learning method strongly supports the principle of differentiated learning. By engaging various senses, breaking down complex information, and creating a stress-free environment, teachers can facilitate every student's learning style. As a result, achieving Learning Outcomes (*Capaian Pembelajaran* or CP) becomes much more efficient and enjoyable for all students.

## 3 Reasons Accelerated Learning Fits Perfectly with the Modern Education Vision

Before discussing how to apply it, it is important to understand why these two concepts complement each other so well in the classroom.

### 1. Both Are Student-Centered

The Merdeka Curriculum requires teachers to no longer be the sole source of information but to act as facilitators. This aligns with *accelerated learning* principles that encourage students to actively participate, discuss, and build their own understanding through direct engagement.

### 2. Supports Differentiated Learning

Every student has a unique pace and way of learning. *Accelerated learning* embraces the theory of *Multiple Intelligences*, allowing teachers to design visual, auditory, or kinesthetic activities. This is the main foundation of differentiated learning required in the current curriculum.

### 3. Focus on Mastery, Not Just Rote Memorization

The new curriculum approach places more importance on literacy, numeracy, and critical reasoning. Fast learning techniques help students move information into long-term memory, not just remembering it for a momentary exam. Students truly master the targeted essential competencies.

## 5 Strategies to Implement Accelerated Learning in the Merdeka Classroom

Implementing this method does not mean you have to change your entire Lesson Plan (*RPP*) or Teaching Module (*Modul Ajar*). Here are five practical strategies that teachers can apply immediately.

### 1. Utilize Chunking Techniques for Learning Outcomes

Learning Outcomes (CP) can sometimes look very broad and complex. Use the *chunking* technique (breaking down information) to simplify them. Break large CPs into Learning Objectives (*Tujuan Pembelajaran* or TP) and Learning Objective Flows (*Alur Tujuan Pembelajaran* or ATP) that are "bite-sized."

When students only need to focus on one small target at each meeting, their cognitive load will decrease drastically. They will feel more confident and master the material faster before moving on to more complicated concepts.

### 2. Multisensory Projects for Strengthening the Pancasila Student Profile (P5)

P5 (*Proyek Penguatan Profil Pelajar Pancasila*) is a hallmark of the Merdeka Curriculum. To ensure this project runs with maximum acceleration, ensure you design it to be multisensory. Do not just tell students to read and write reports.

Invite them to conduct field observations, interview sources, create artwork, or perform role-play-based presentations. The more senses involved (seeing, hearing, moving, touching), the faster and stronger the student's brain records the learning experience.

### 3. Create a "Brain-Friendly" Learning Environment

According to the original theory of *accelerated learning*, the brain works best in a state of *relaxed alertness*. A classroom environment full of pressure or threats of punishment will close access to the part of the brain that processes learning (the prefrontal cortex).

Free the class from stressful nuances. Play slow-tempo instrumental music while students work on independent tasks. Arrange seating to be more flexible and allow for collaboration. A psychologically comfortable classroom will accelerate the information absorption process.

### 4. Use Mind Mapping for Formative Assessment

Formative assessment does not always have to be a written quiz or multiple choice. The *mind mapping* method is one of the pillars of *accelerated learning* that is extraordinarily effective for measuring student understanding comprehensively.

After studying a topic, ask students to create a *mind map* with colors and images according to their creativity. This trains critical reasoning skills and information organization. You can quickly see how well students connect essential concepts.

### 5. Apply the Feynman Technique in Group Discussions

The Feynman Technique requires someone to explain a complex concept in the simplest language possible. In the classroom, you can pair students up and ask them to teach each other the material just discussed.

This step fits perfectly with the spirit of collaboration in the Merdeka Curriculum. When students are able to explain the material to their friends in their own language, it is concrete proof that they have achieved the expected competence, not just parroting the teacher's explanation.

## Challenges Teachers May Face (and Solutions)

Although it sounds ideal, the transition to an accelerated learning method certainly has its own challenges in the field.

**Time Constraints for Preparation:** Designing multisensory and *brain-friendly* activities requires extra preparation at the beginning.
*Solution:* Teachers do not need to do everything alone. Collaborate in the Learning Community (*Komunitas Belajar* or Kombel) at school to share ideas and compile Teaching Modules together.

**Resistance from Passive Students:** Students accustomed to being spoon-fed information may initially reject or be confused by learning methods that demand they be active.
*Solution:* Make the transition gradually. Start with one small activity, such as a 5-minute discussion session, before moving on to large-scale collaborative projects. Give appreciation for every small progress they show.

## Conclusion

Integrating **accelerated learning in the Merdeka Curriculum** is not just about increasing the teacher's workload, but perfecting the teaching approach itself. This method gives spirit to the curriculum's vision of liberating every child's potential.

By breaking material into small parts (*chunking*), activating all senses, eliminating stress in the classroom, and facilitating peer teaching (*Feynman technique*), the learning process will proceed more organically. Let's create a generation of learners who are not only fast at absorbing knowledge but also love the learning process throughout their lives.

## FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

**1. Is the accelerated learning method suitable for all subjects?**
Yes, absolutely suitable. This concept is a brain-based strategy, not specific to one field of science. Whether it is Mathematics, Language, Science, or Art, the multisensory approach and simplification of material (*chunking*) will make any subject easier to master.

**2. Does this method require expensive costs or sophisticated tools in the classroom?**
Not at all. *Accelerated learning* relies more on pedagogical creativity than expensive technology. Group discussions, drawing *mind maps*, *role-playing*, and creating an emotionally friendly classroom environment require absolutely no additional cost.

**3. How do we assess students if we use this fast learning method?**
Use authentic and formative assessment instruments recommended by the Merdeka Curriculum. Instead of rote exams, assess students based on work portfolios, presentation rubrics, *mind mapping* results, or their involvement during the Pancasila Student Profile Strengthening Project (P5).

**4. Can students with special needs also feel the benefits?**
Of course. This approach is actually very inclusive because it supports visual, auditory, and kinesthetic learning styles. Teachers can adjust the complexity of the material (*content differentiation*) while still using the principle of a stress-free learning environment.

**5. How much adjustment time is needed for students to get used to it?**
Usually, it takes about 3 to 4 weeks for students to get used to this highly interactive method, especially for those who have been accustomed to the one-way lecture method. Teacher consistency is the main key.
