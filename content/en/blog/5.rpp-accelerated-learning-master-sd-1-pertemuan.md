## Condensing MASTER Syntax into 1 Meeting in 5th Grade Elementary

If we previously discussed the application of Accelerated Learning for weekly preschool (PAUD) plans, we now turn to a different challenge. How do we compile an Accelerated Learning Lesson Plan (*RPP*) for 5th-grade elementary students that must be completed in just 1 meeting or approximately 2 Lesson Hours (2 x 35 minutes)?

Upper-grade elementary students (grades 4, 5, and 6) have longer attention spans and better analytical skills than early childhood students. However, they are also more prone to boredom if the teacher relies solely on the one-way lecture method.

Using Colin Rose's **MASTER** syntax (*Motivate, Acquire, Search, Trigger, Exhibit, Reflect*) in a single 70-minute session is entirely possible and remarkably effective. The key lies in strict time management and seamless activity transitions, ensuring students remain active from the beginning to the end of the lesson.

## Time Management: 6 MASTER Phases in 70 Minutes

To ensure all stages of Accelerated Learning are carried out in 1 meeting (2 Lesson Hours), the teacher must act like an orchestra conductor. Here is the recommended time distribution for each phase of Colin Rose's syntax:

### 1. M - Motivating Your Mind (5 Minutes)
This phase is the "hook" to grab the attention of 5th graders. Do not start by telling them to open their textbooks. Start with a mysterious question, a short story, an image that sparks curiosity, or a physical object they can see directly. The goal is to build a positive learning *mood*.

### 2. A - Acquiring the Information (10 Minutes)
In this stage, the teacher provides an understanding of basic concepts (material exposition). Remember, the duration is short. Use a multisensory approach. Show a short animated video (Visual & Auditory) or use large interactive posters. Avoid writing on the whiteboard, which consumes too much time.

### 3. S - Searching Out the Meaning (25 Minutes)
This is the core of learning. This exploration phase takes up the most time. Give students the freedom to work in small groups. They must solve problems, construct something, or find answers through educational games. Their brains work hardest in this phase.

### 4. T - Triggering the Memory (10 Minutes)
After they find the meaning, ensure the material is stored in long-term memory. Use mnemonics, songs with changed lyrics, or chained flashcards. This activity must be fast, fun, and involve movement (kinesthetic).

### 5. E - Exhibiting What You Know (15 Minutes)
Give students the opportunity to show off what they have learned. In a 1-meeting session, the exhibition could be a short group presentation (3 minutes each), a *gallery walk*, or a short role-play in front of the class. This will boost their self-confidence.

### 6. R - Reflecting on How You've Learned (5 Minutes)
The closing phase. Don't just ask, "Are there any questions?". Use guided reflection, such as asking students to write one interesting thing they learned today on sticky notes, then sticking them on the whiteboard before leaving the class.

## Example of Accelerated Learning Lesson Plan (MASTER Syntax) Grade 5

To provide a clear picture, let's create an example of a Daily Lesson Plan / Teaching Module for the Natural Sciences (IPA) subject for Grade 5 Elementary.

* **Subject:** Natural Sciences (IPA)
* **Class / Semester:** V (Five) / 1
* **Core Material:** Human Digestive System
* **Time Allocation:** 1 Meeting (2 x 35 Minutes)

### Preliminary Activities (10 Minutes)
* **Apperception & Prayer:** The teacher opens the class with a cheerful greeting and joint prayer.
* **M - Motivating Your Mind (5 Minutes):** The teacher takes a bitten apple out of a mystery bag. The teacher asks, *"Children, if I swallow this apple right now, what do you think it will turn into tomorrow morning when it comes out?"* Students will usually laugh and answer in unison. The teacher then emphasizes, *"Today, we will become detectives to trace the long journey of the apple inside our bellies!"*

### Core Activities (45 Minutes)
* **A - Acquiring the Information (10 Minutes):** The teacher plays a short animated video (4 minutes duration) about the journey of food. After the video ends, the teacher sticks a large poster of unlabeled human organs on the whiteboard.
* **S - Searching Out the Meaning (25 Minutes):** The teacher divides students into 5 groups. Each group is given a "Detective Kit" containing cut-out images of organs (mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine) along with their functions. The group's task is to match the organs and functions, then paste them sequentially on a large cardboard sheet.
* **T - Triggering the Memory (10 Minutes):** To remember the order of digestion, the teacher teaches a simple song using a familiar tune like "Balonku Ada Lima" or "If You're Happy and You Know It". The lyrics are changed to: *"Mouth, esophagus, stomach... Small intestine, large intestine, then the anus!"* while pointing to their respective stomach areas. Repeated 3 times with increasing tempo.


### Closing Activities (15 Minutes)
* **E - Exhibiting What You Know (10 Minutes):** Each group sticks their cardboard creation on the classroom wall (*Gallery Walk*). The teacher randomly selects 2 groups to present their work loudly in front of the other friends. Other groups give an appreciation clap (*Tepuk Salut*).
* **R - Reflecting on How You've Learned (5 Minutes):** The teacher distributes one sticky note to each student. Students are asked to draw an emoticon of their feelings today and write down one digestive organ they think has the greatest function. Sticky notes are stuck on the whiteboard as they prepare to go home. Closing prayer.

## Key Steps to Compiling a Successful Daily Teaching Module

Drafting a Lesson Plan like the one above may look easy, but execution requires mature preparation. Here are the key steps when you compile it on paper:

1.  **Determine One Specific Sub-Material**
    The weakness of teachers when teaching with short time allocations is trying to cram in too much material. In Grade 5, ensure the Learning Objective for 2 Lesson Hours is very specific. Do not discuss digestive diseases and anatomy at the same time; focus on the order of organs first.

2.  **Prepare Multisensory Media Beforehand**
    The MASTER syntax relies on Visual, Auditory, and Kinesthetic (VAK) learning styles. When compiling the Lesson Plan, ensure you write down what media will be used. Prepare videos, print puzzle sheets, and practice mnemonic songs before you enter the class. Do not look for ideas while the lesson is in progress.

3.  **Write Estimated Time Beside Activities**
    Always include a target minute count in every activity of your Lesson Plan (e.g., Searching - 25 minutes). In class, set a timer or small alarm that students can see. This not only helps the teacher be disciplined with time but also trains Grade 5 students to learn to obey deadlines.


## Challenges in 1 Meeting and Solutions

There are several challenges that often arise when condensing Accelerated Learning into one session.

**First**, group discussions that take up time (Search Phase). Grade 5 children are often absorbed in chatting about other things. The solution is to give very specific instructions before they work. Appoint a group leader and tell them that the work must be finished when the timer sounds.

**Second**, students being shy during the Exhibiting phase. Not all upper-grade children have the confidence to perform. The solution is to make the exhibition cooperative (*Gallery Walk*). They do not need to stand alone in front of the class, but simply stand beside their group table and explain to other groups stopping by.

## Conclusion

Compiling an Accelerated Learning Lesson Plan with MASTER syntax for Grade 5 Elementary in 1 meeting (2 Lesson Hours) is about speed, precision, and maximum sensory engagement.

By intelligently dividing the 70 minutes into Motivating, Acquiring, Searching, Triggering, Exhibiting, and Reflecting phases, you prevent the boredom that often strikes upper-grade students. Learning becomes a valuable experience deeply embedded in their memory, proving that fast and effective learning can happen in just one face-to-face session.

## FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

**1. Can this 1-meeting Lesson Plan be applied to Mathematics?**
Absolutely. For Mathematics, the *Acquire* phase can be an exposition of basic formulas with colorful visuals. The *Search* phase is solving word problems in groups using props. The *Trigger* phase can be a chant to remember formulas quickly.

**2. Is it mandatory to use video in the "Acquiring" phase?**
Not mandatory. If school facilities are inadequate, you can use other visual media such as large posters, interesting drawings on the whiteboard, or the teacher demonstrating directly (for example, doing a light experiment in front of the class).

**3. What if the "Searching" phase takes more than 25 minutes?**
As a teacher, you have the right to flexibility. If students are very enthusiastic and the learning process is meaningful, you can extend the *Search* phase, but you must shorten the duration of the *Exhibit* phase (for example, only 1 group presents as a representative).

**4. Is the MASTER syntax suitable for the *Kurikulum Merdeka* at the elementary level?**
Very suitable. The *Searching* and *Exhibiting* phases in the MASTER model align perfectly with the principles of Project-Based Learning (PBL) and differentiated learning emphasized in the *Kurikulum Merdeka*.

**5. For Grade 5, is singing in the "Triggering" phase not considered too childish?**
No, as long as the approach is right. Grade 5 students like pop songs or songs that are currently viral. You can use tunes from the latest hits on TikTok or the radio, then change the lyrics to the subject material. They will actually feel that the method is very relevant and cool.
